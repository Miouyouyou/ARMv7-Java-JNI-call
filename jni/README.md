This folder only exists to [satifsy `ndk-build` bizarre conditions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14156596/ndk-cant-find-the-application-directory/20914520#20914520). If you build the library manually, or with GNU Make, you can delete this folder.
**This folder has nothing with building or installing the Android APK.**
